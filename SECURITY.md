Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it to me privately so that I can address it.

Please report any vulnerabilities directly to me via email at: [Your-Email-Address@example.com]

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following:

    A clear description of the vulnerability.

    The version of the application you are using.

    Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if possible.

    Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that can help me understand the issue.

I will do my best to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will provide an update on the status of the fix. I ask that you please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a patch has been released.

Thank you for helping to keep the Retail Operations Suite secure.
